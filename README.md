# Data-Science
Examples of data science analysis and model building

## [CO concentration analysis](https://github.com/elisiojsj/Data-Science/blob/master/CO_concentration-analysis.ipynb)
This is a good example of data science analysis. Main topics of this work are: 
* Missing data cleaning.
* Outliers dealing.
* Data patterns visualization.
* Correlation analysis.
* Prediction model with **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**.
* XGBoost tuning with Optuna.

## [Galton Hereditary Stature](https://github.com/elisiojsj/Data-Science/blob/master/Galton_Hereditary_Stature-analysis.ipynb)
A Probabilistic Programming approach to the famous Galton Hereditary Stature dataset which is the basis for the [paper](http://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1886-jaigi-regression-stature.pdf) that popularized the concept of regression.
* Analysis of the dataset
* Bayesian Hierarchical Linear Regression using PyMC3.
